Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
It's a form of computer sceince that deals with programming i.e web development and design and creating applications. 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software enginnering involves the application of engineering principles to software creation to ensure that it is reliable, efficient, maintainable, and meets the requirements of users. It invloves the entire SDLC whilst tradional programming focuses on writing a code to solve a specificproblem. 

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
 SDLC is a structured process used for developing software applications. The following are it's phases:
 1. Requirement Analysis: To gather and analyze the business requirements and understand the needs and expectations of the users.
 2. Planning: To plan the entire project, set timelines, define resources, and create a roadmap for development.
 3. Design: To create a detailed blueprint of the software application that guides the development team.
 4. Implementation: To convert design documents into the actual software code.
 5. Testing: To ensure the developed software meets the required quality standards and is free of defects.
 6. Deployment: It involves making the software available to users.
 7. Maintenance: To provide ongoing support, fix issues, and implement enhancements based on user feedback.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Key differences include:
Agile is iterative and incremental while Waterfall model is linear and sequesntial
Agile is highly flexible and adaptable to change while Waterfall model is inflexible and difficult to accomodate changes.
Agile had continuous customer involvement and feedback while Waterfalll model is limited to requirement phases.
Agile has projects with evolving requirements and uncertain in scope while Waterfall model has projects with well-defined and stable requirements. 

Uses:
Agile is preferred when the project scope and requirements are likely to evolve, when rapid delivery of software is needed, stakeholders requiring frequent updates and feature demonstrations.
Waterfall model is preferred when the project has fixed and well understood requirements, the project beinglarge-scale and requiring thorough governance and when stakeholders may not be available for continous involvement. 

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

It's a step in SDLC that involved gathering and analyzing business requirements whilst understanding the needs and expectaions of users.

2. Reduced risk of project failure. It helps identify and address potential issues early in the project, reducing the risk of project faulire to unmet user needs.
3. Cost and time effienct. By identifying and addressing requirements issues early, the project can avoid costly and time-consuming revisions later in the development processs.
4. Quality assurance. Well-defined requirements provide a basis for quality asurance activities, ensuring that the final product meets the specified criteria and standards. 

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity refers to the design principle of segmenting a software system into distinct, self-contained units or modules with each module encapsulating a specific piece of functionality and interacting with other modules through well-defined interfaces.

It improves maintainability as changes made are isolated, easier debugging and makes understanding simpler. 

Scalability is enhanced since developmnt of different modules is independent, modules can be reused within the same system or different projects and also it has flexible upgrading without impacting the entire system.

Testing in Software Engineering:
